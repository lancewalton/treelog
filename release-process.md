Multiple Scalaz Versions Supported
----------------------------------
Master tracks the latest version of scalaz, branches track previous minor versions. eg. master scalaz 7.3, branches scalaz-7.2 and scalaz-7.1.  

When scalaz's minor version changes, create a new branch for the old version.

Master is the master, merge into the other branches to maintain docs and compatibility.

Publish the Scaladoc
--------------------
Publish the scaladoc to gh-pages: sbt "doc makeSite ghpagesPushSite"

   SNAPSHOT versions have docs generated under /api/master, but release versions are under /api/treelog-x.y.z

Publish Snapshots to Sonatype
-----------------------------
  For snapshots make sure the version number has a -SNAPSHOT suffix. To release to staging, remove the suffix.
  In both cases use 'sbt publishSigned'

1. Add changes to the [release notes](release_notes.md).
2. run: sbt release release-version <release version> next-version <next release, usually XXX-SNAPSHOT>
